		<content>Added two water-filters, industrial versions of the clean and dirty water filters. These cost 10x the resources and power but have 10x the throughput. This is mainly for lowering the performance hit for using lots of normal water-filters since performance is directly connected to the amount of water-connected buildings.</content>
