- Added industrial versions of the two water-filters with 10x the throughput

- This info was a part of the original mod but was removed by the previous mod author for some reason: ”This mod should NOT be applied to saved games, it is best to start with a new game. This mod cannot be removed form a savegame.”

Update: Mar 16
This is an update for compatibility with Rimworld 1.1. The dependency on Modcheck was removed due to the delay in updating it for 1.1. Any pre-existing bugs with the mod likely still exist.

Other changes: Sounds have been updated to use custom sounds instead of the built-in sounds.

Known issues: 
-The sound for drawing water is still using the built-in sound for cooking.
-Not adding enough water to a caravan does not produce a warning.

Please refer to the 1.0 mod for FAQs and other information:

This workshop post was intended to get a working 1.1 version of this mod. Eventually my goal will be to merge this back into schoos76's workshop post and github repository as I'm not a skilled game programmer.
